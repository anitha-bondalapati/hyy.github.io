            <p class="paraline">Fresh Fruit PVT. LTD. is an ISO 22000:2005 certified enterprise formed by us,the local farming community who have brought together their skills and learning in various fields. Agriculture, the lone means of livelihood in the heart of the Vijayawada, is mainly affected by the lack of value addition to the agro products.

            Aware of the ground realities, we have ventured to take a step towards remedying this lacuna and restore the local hoary ethos. It is our intention to reestablish interest in agriculture among the youth, which is fast eroding. We strive to bring entrepreneurship conducive to the local conditions and accomplish holistic progress. We believe that ultimately the exodus of youth from the pristine heart of the cities would stop and a reversal is achieved.
            Our first choice has been Fruit Processing with special emphasis on the preservation of traditional agro products retaining all their nutritional contents. It is our endeavour to record a healthy growth and branch out at a later date.
